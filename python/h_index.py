# @Descirbe: Jorge is a physicist who has published many research papers
# and wants to know how much impact they have had in the academic community.
# To measure impact, he has developed a metric, H-index, to score
# each of his papers based on the number of times it has been cited by other papers.
# Specifically, the H-index score of a researcher is the largest integer H
# such that the researcher has H papers with at least H
# citations each.

# Jorge has written N papers in his lifetime. The i-th paper has Ci citations.
# Each paper was written sequentially in the order provided, and
# the number of citations that each paper has will never change.
# Please help Jorge determine his H-index score after each paper he wrote.
#
# create a function to calculate the H-index score after each paper Jorge wrote
