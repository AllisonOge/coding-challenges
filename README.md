# coding-challenges
A compilation of some of the coding challenges I have encountered in my software engineering career journey. The problem sets will be touched with as many approaches as possible, brute force, recursion and so on and in the following programming languages python, c++ and javascript. 

The problem statements are briefly stated in the respective files but the links to the source are also provided in those files as well as in the table below. For some of the test cases (e.g. google kickstart problems), the test sets need to be downloaded and placed in the correct path ([watch this](https://youtu.be/OCxxdLKWS1s)).

There will be links to detailed notes and helpful videos if it is needed to aid your understanding. Have fun just like I did!

# Summary of problems, solution details, problem category and difficulty level
