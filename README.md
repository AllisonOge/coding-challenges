# coding-challenges
A compilation of some of the coding challenges I have encountered on my software engineering career journey. The problem sets will be touched with as many approaches as possible, brute force, recursion and so on and in the following programming languages python, c++ and javascript. There will be links to detailed notes and helpful videos if it is needed to aid your understanding. Have fun just like I did!
